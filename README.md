# Next-Word Prediction Using NLP

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to predict the next word in a sequence of text. It leverages machine learning techniques and pre-trained language models to provide contextually accurate word suggestions.

## Features
- Predicts the next word based on the input text.
- Supports customizable datasets for training and testing.
- Utilizes pre-trained NLP models like GPT, BERT, or custom RNN/LSTM models.
- Interactive user interface for real-time predictions.

## Requirements
To set up and run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `nltk`
  - `transformers`
  - `torch`
  - `Flask` (if creating a web interface)

## Applications
- Auto-completion tools
- Intelligent text editors
- Chatbots
- Language learning platforms

## Future Work
- Integrate additional languages.
- Improve accuracy with larger datasets.
- Deploy the model on cloud platforms.
